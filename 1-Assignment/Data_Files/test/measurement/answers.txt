Note : Reporting as (client side, server side).


Comments : 
While the proportion varied between multiple runs, the sum always remained nearly constant, as expected.
We expect the bandwidth to be shared when there are multiple connections.
In Q3, Q4, we were not able to achieve true parallelism, and hence bandwidth at the bottlenecks is not shared 100% fairly.
We do not expect the latency to be affected, as we expect that statistical multiplexing is used, and the medium is not time shared.


Question 2.
-----------

h1 communicates with h4 through the path h1 - s2 - L1 - L2 - L3- s4 - h4

Expected latency is the sum of latency of individual links, here sum(80.19, 20.17, 60.52, links from switches to host) = 160.88 ms.
Reason : latency is additive, as data needs to pass through all the links in the path.
Actual observed RTT = 160.50 ms


Expected throughput is the minimum of individual links, i.e., min(throughput of L1, L2, L3) =  (21.07 Mbps, 19.16 Mbps)
Reason : throughput is capped at the link with the minimum bandwidth, as this acts as the bottleneck.
Actual observed throughput = (19.23 Mbps, 17.81 Mbps)

The observations seem to match our prediction.


Question 3.
-----------

Two simultaneous connections :-
h1 - h4
h8 - h10

Expected latency is the sum of the latencies of the links from h1 to h4 = sum(80.19, 20.17, 60.52) = 160.88
Expected latency is the sum of the latencies of the links from h8 to h10 = sum(80.19, 20.17, 60.52) = 160.88
Actual observed RTT (h1,h4) = 160.89
Actual observed RTT (h8,h10) = 160.91

Expected throughput is the minimum of the bandwidths of the links, but divided by two, since the links will be simultaneously shared (multiplexed) by the two connections.
Expected throughput (h1,h4) = [(21.07 Mbps, 19.16 Mbps)/2] = (10.53 Mbps, 9.58 Mbps)
Expected throughput (h8,h10) = [(21.07 Mbps, 19.16 Mbps)/2] = (10.53 Mbps, 9.58 Mbps)
Actual observed throughput (h1,h4) = (10.55 Mbps, 9.26 Mbps)
Actual observed throughput (h1,h4) = (10.36 Mbps, 9.25 Mbps)

NOTE : the bandwidths might not be strictly shared, but they do need to add up to the capacity..
Exact sharing may vary depending upon start time of each communication, and other factors.


Three simultaneous connections :-
h1 - h4 
h7 - h9
h8 - h10

Expected latency is the sum of the latencies of the links from h1 to h4 = sum(80.19, 20.17, 60.52) = 160.88
Expected latency is the sum of the latencies of the links from h8 to h10 = sum(80.19, 20.17, 60.52) = 160.88
Expected latency is the sum of the latencies of the links from h7 to h9 = sum(80.19, 20.17, 60.52) = 160.88
Actual latency (h1,h4) = 160.89 ms
Actual latency (h7,h9) = 160.97 ms
Actual latency (h8,h10) = 161.01 ms 

Expected throughput (h1,h4) = [(21.07 Mbps, 19.16 Mbps)/3] = (7.02 Mbps, 6.05 Mbps)
Expected throughput (h7,h9) = [(21.07 Mbps, 19.16 Mbps)/3] = (7.02 Mbps, 6.05 Mbps)
Expected throughput (h8,h10) = [(21.07 Mbps, 19.16 Mbps)/3] = (7.02 Mbps, 6.05 Mbps)

Actual observed throughput (h1,h4)   = (6.38 Mbps, 5.89 Mbps)
Actual observed throughput (h7,h9)   = (7.29 Mbps, 6.61 Mbps)
Actual observed throughput (h8,h10) = (6.83 Mbps, 6.19 Mbps)



Question 4.
-----------

Path (h1,h4) : H1 - L1 - L2 - L3 - H4
Path (h5,h6) : H5 - L4 - L2 - L5 - H6

shared links : L2

Expected latency for (h1,h4) = sum of latencies of links = sum(80.19, 20.17, 60.52) = 160.88 ms
Expected latency for (h5,h6) = sum of latencies of links = sum(10.43, 20.17, 10.44) = 41.04 ms
Reason : sharing the link shouldnâ€™t affect latency
Actual observed RTT (h1,h4) = 160.89 ms
Actual observed RTT (h5,h6) = 40.75 ms

Expected throughput (h1,h4) = min of available bandwidths at each link = min(L1, (L2/2), L3) = (20.07 Mbps, 19.8 Mbps)
Expected throughput (h5,h6) = min of available bandwidths at each link = min(L4, (L2/2), L5) = (20.07 Mbps, 19.8 Mbps)
Reason : shared link is the bottleneck in both the connections.
NOTE again, bandwidth limit does not have to be exactly L2/2, but the individual capacities should add up to the limit of L2.
Actual observed throughput (h1,h4) = (19.68 Mbps, 18.45 Mbps) 
Actual observed throughput (h5,h6) = (22.12 Mbps, 20.74 Mbps)
